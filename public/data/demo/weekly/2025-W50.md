# Week Summary - 2025-W50

## Week In One Paragraph
Strong week with excellent progress on multiple fronts. Successfully onboarded Priya to the team and she's already contributing. Made critical architecture decisions for the analytics platform that will serve us well long-term. Customer site visit at TechCorp provided valuable insights that shaped our Q1 roadmap. Team dynamics are healthy, and the sprint retrospective surfaced actionable improvements. Wrapped up the week with meaningful progress on demo mode implementation.

## Top 3 Outcomes
1. **Analytics Platform Architecture Finalized** - Completed comprehensive technical design with security review. Decision on PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB gives us the scalability we need while keeping operational complexity manageable.

2. **Successful Team Onboarding** - Priya integrated smoothly into the team. Sarah volunteered to mentor her, which is great for both of them. First week went well with good questions and eagerness to learn.

3. **Customer-Driven Roadmap Refinement** - TechCorp site visit surfaced important use cases we hadn't fully considered. Marcus did excellent job translating feedback into actionable features. Got executive buy-in for Q1 hiring plan.

## Key Decisions Made
- Database choice for analytics: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
- API versioning strategy: Semantic versioning with deprecation windows
- Q1 hiring plan approved: 2 additional engineers and 1 QA specialist
- Team process improvements from retrospective: daily standups moving to async, better PR review SLAs

## Challenges & Blockers
- Build pipeline reliability issues need urgent attention
- Infrastructure team capacity constraints causing delays
- Product-engineering communication gaps on requirements clarity
- Third-party API stability concerns
